# iptmon: Simple iptables bandwidth monitor

![graph](./graph.png)

`iptmon` is a script used to create and update `iptables` firewall rules to count transmit and recieve traffic to/from each host. It is intended to be triggered by dnsmasq using the `--dhcp-script` option, so that as new hosts are added and old leases expire, rules are updated dynamically.

Static hosts defined either in `/etc/hosts` or through `uci set dhcp.domain[]` are supported since v0.1.0.

Packet and byte counts can then be scraped by `collectd` using the `iptables` plugin. See `files/etc/collectd/conf.d/iptables.conf` for configuration.

Furthermore, `collectd` can push data to InfluxDB, which can in turn be used as a data source for [Grafana dashboards](https://github.com/oofnikj/docker-openwrt/tree/master/monitoring).

Inspired by [wrtbwmon](https://github.com/pyrovski/wrtbwmon).

## Dependencies

To make use of `iptmon`, you should already be using `luci-app-statistics` and `collectd` to collect and process metrics.

The `iptables` module of `collectd` is used to collect per-host metrics.

`iptmon` depends on `dnsmasq` version >=2.80-16, which merged a [PR](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/2842) to enable `script-arp` so make sure your `dnsmasq` package is up-to-date.


If you are using `luci-app-statistics` prior to git commit [`4778aa6`](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/commit/4778aa62af311fc06ac9f2d9ee76eb814ec22a71) you will need to upgrade as this commit merged a [PR](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/pull/3763) to fix the ip6tables firewall statistics view in LuCI.


**Note** that if you have software offloading enabled `iptmon` **will not** be able to track bandwidth usage properly.

## Add feed

If you are building your own image from source and want to include `iptmon`:

    $ echo "src-git iptmon https://github.com/oofnikj/iptmon.git" >> feeds.conf
    $ scripts/feeds update && scripts/feeds install iptmon
    $ make menuconfig

## Installation on OpenWrt

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/oofnikj/iptmon/releases) page to downloaded the latest `.ipk`.

`iptmon` is a shell script, so it should work on all architectures.

```
# VERSION=0.1.4
# wget https://github.com/oofnikj/iptmon/releases/download/v${VERSION}/iptmon_${VERSION}-1_all.ipk -O iptmon_${VERSION}-1_all.ipk
# opkg install ./iptmon_${VERSION}-1_all.ipk
```

## Removal
```
# opkg remove iptmon
```
